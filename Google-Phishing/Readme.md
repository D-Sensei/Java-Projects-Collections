#An CyberSecurity Application to show phishing on local Network

Phishing attacks involve cybercriminals creating fake websites or emails that mimic legitimate ones in order to trick users into revealing their personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.
This project is a demonstration of a real-life phishing attack; add your credentials and try it out. This could be used as a final year project.

Note: Ofc,I meant forged credentials (your second account).
